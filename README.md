# Pet-Database

##Hosted Site: https://pet-data-app.onrender.com

When this project was first assinged, the original plan was to review neighbor's dogs. However, the project was disorganized and unable to deploy. So the focus changed to creating a vet database using supabase for the database, and render to deploy the website. In this current project some major roadblocks were trying to create a working navbar, and creating the routes for all the pages. We wished to create a working login page and of course a working update/delete button.
