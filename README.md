# Pet-Database

##Hosted Site: https://pet-data-app.onrender.com

When this project was first assinged, the original plan was to review neighbor's dogs. However, the project was disorganized and unable to deploy. The focus was changed last minute giving us a week to create a vet database using supabase for the database, and render to deploy the website. In this current project some major roadblocks were trying to create a working navbar using React-Bootstrap and creating the routes for all the pages to function correctly. The group hoped to create a working login page and a working update/delete button. 

Joseph and Julian did a majority of the front-end work while Rodrigo did a lot of work on supabase and the back-end of the project.
